# ML from Scratch

A collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using NumPy. This project is a personal exploration of the core mathematical concepts behind machine learning. By re-implementing these algorithms without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn for computations, I aim to deepen my understanding of how things work under the hood.

## Features
- **Supervised Learning**
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Optimization**
  - Gradient Descent
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent
